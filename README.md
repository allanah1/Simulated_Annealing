# Simulated_Annealing
Achieve state of the art results on traveling salesman problem using simulated annealing with a different type of stopping conditions. 
Simulated annealing algorithm is a very useful optimization technique but has its drawback in convergence time. Nonetheless, you are almost always guaranteed to find global optima.
